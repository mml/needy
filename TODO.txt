- Implement caching
  - Could start with a basic HTTP caching client that would get 304s rather than
    200s back from HTTP servers.  Then expand that idea to include SINCE
    elements in IMAP queries and mtime comparison operators on directories for
    the iChat things.
  - Eventually could unify the whole thing in a standard caching interface.
  - To start: is there an existing Ruby HTTP client library that implements a
    transparent cache?
