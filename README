Library to help you know which projects are getting a bit stale.

Sometimes it slowly creeps up on you that you haven't done anything with X in
a few weeks... or even months, and next thing you know getting started again
seems somewhat hard.  I am pretty prone to this kind of problem; I guess that
part of my brain doesn't work very well.  So this is a simple attempt to
factor that part of my brain out in to some code.

Sample output:

             $FRIEND  475.0 hours
              $BUDDY  256.6 hours
                  lj  235.0 hours
                  ol  191.9 hours
              tumblr  167.6 hours
               m0x65   94.6 hours
              flickr   46.8 hours
             twitter   24.3 hours
                $GIG   22.0 hours
                $PAL    1.1 hours
